# timeSeriesStockPredNN
Please Note that this was a simple learning based Activity which was fully grasped through the youtube video by Kriti Mahajan Ma'am 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr-ztgKuaSA).
I learnt how 1D Conv NN and LSTMs are very useful and run hand-in-hand while predicting stock prices. I also learnt how linear models like OLS and SARIMA,
ARIMA are useful linear model but have their own down sides.
Also Note that this was just for learning and is not production level highly accurate model. I was not able to predict the Stock values for LSTM as training was
highly resource consuming (though I am looking forward in trying it out on cloud platforms.)
